## Frontend 
Built with create-react-app, functional & class components, redux, nodejs, expressjs, passportjs, bootstrap, javascript, css, html5 and MongoDB.

Plus you will see how to use correctly:

- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
- [React Hooks] (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Backend
Using [MongDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com) as simple backend.
Using [NodeJs] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Using [ExpressJs] (https://expressjs.com/)

### `Node Server`
Make sure to type into console 'npm install' before typing 'npm run dev' from the project root directory, this runs the codes to start the server from backend and it automatically starts the frontend as well. Then Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it on the browser. 

### "To run Frontend separately and alone"
Make sure to type this on your console "cd frontend" and then run "npm install" to install all dependencies before running "npm start" which starts the frontend react dev server alone.

## Browser Support
Compatible with every evergreen browser.
